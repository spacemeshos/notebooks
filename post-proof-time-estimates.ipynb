    "The PoST proof is a long-running task whose duration is probabilistic. However, given the disk read speed and AES computation speed, we know the exactly how the duration is distributed. Moreover, as the PoST proof progresses, we get additional information, and can update both the expected time and the percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To recall, the PoST proof basically repeats the following steps until it is successful:\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of labels in the PoST data.\n",
    "1. Compute $r$ k2pows for set of $m=r\\cdot b$ parallel nonces, in batches of size $b$.\n",
    "2. For $i$ in range ($n$):\n",
    "\n",
    "   a.  read label $i$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b.  hash label $i$ (number of hashes is $r$)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c.  For every nonce, check if hashed label passes $k_1/n$ threshold. Call such a label \"good\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d.  Return **success**  if, for any nonce, we have found at least $k_2$  good labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a rough estimate, let's assume we never stop in the middle of a pass (i.e., even if we found $k_2$ good labels we still do the whole pass).  This simplifies things, since the time for a single complete pass depends only on k2pow,  read and compute speed (this simplification means we always overestimate the time). Let's denote $K_i$ the number of hash invocations it takes to solve the $i^{th}$ k2pow, and $R$ the time it takes to do a single read/hash pass over the data for the $m$ nonces. \n",
    "\n",
    "R is essentially a constant that depends on the CPU/disk parameters. We can estimate $R$ by benchmarking for a small set of  $\\alpha\\cdot n$ labels, then dividing by $\\alpha$. For a single nonce batch, $K_i$ is a random variable that is [geometrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution) distributed with parameter $1/d$, where $d$ is the expected k2pow difficulty (i.e., expected number of hash invocations).  For multiple nonce batches (i.e., $r>1$), $K_i$ is the sum of $r$ geometric variables, which is distributed as a [negative binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution), with parameters $p=1/d$ and $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote $T$ the total time for $x$ passes over the data, including the k2pow. Then\n",
    "$$ T=R\\cdot x+\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{x} K_i}{\\text{hashrate}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single nonce, the number of good labels out of $n$ is distributed $B(n,k_1/n)$ --- that is, [binomially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) with parameters $n$ and $p=k_1/n$.  Since passes are independent, at the beginning of  every pass, the probability that this pass will be successful *for a specific nonce* is $q=Pr[B(n,k1/n) \\ge k_2]$. We are trying $m$ nonces in parallel, and a pass will fail only if *all* of the nonces fail. Since the events are independent for every nonce, the probability that a pass succeeds is $q_m = 1-(1-q)^m$.\n"

    "### Percentile Calculation\n",
    "The percentile calculation is a little more complex: the number of passes required to succeed with probability $p^*$ is $\\log(1-p^*)/\\log(1-q_m)$. (To see this, let $X$ be the number of failures before success, note that for every $x\\ge 1$, $\\Pr[X>x]=(1-q_m)^x$, then solve for $x$ such that $p^*=\\Pr[X\\le x] = 1-\\Pr[X>x]$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume the k2pow effort $K_i=d\\cdot r$ is a constant, this gives us a simple percentile calculation: $(R+d\\cdot r/\\text{hashrate})\\cdot \\log(1-p^*)/\\log(1-q_m)$.\n",
    "Since $K_i$ is not constant, computing the percentile exactly is more involved. However, we can still lower-bound the time for a given percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we consider separately the time for reading/processing nonces and the total k2pow time. The former is given by $R\\cdot \\log(1-p^*)/\\log(1-q_m)$. For the latter, if we condition on the number of passes being $x$, then we need to solve $x\\cdot r$ k2pows, hence the total k2pow effort $K=\\sum_{i=1}^x K_i$ is distributed as a negative binomial variable with parameters $1/d$ and $x\\cdot r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every $\\epsilon\\in (0,1-p^*)$, we can find $K^*$ and $x$ such that $\\Pr[K\\le K^* | X\\le x] \\ge (1-\\epsilon)$ and $\\Pr[X \\le x] \\ge p^*/(1-\\epsilon)$. Then \n",
